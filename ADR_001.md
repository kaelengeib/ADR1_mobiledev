ADR 001: Architectural Decisions for Retail Company Mobile App Development (Scenario 1)

Status: Accepted/Proposed

Date: 2024-03-18

Authors: Kaelen Geib, Zac Ruff, Nicky Bartsch, Braydon Anderson

## Context: 
Development of a mobile app for a retail company, incorporating features for browsing and purchasing products, viewing order history, tracking deliveries, and a loyalty program, with specific requirements for offline access, push notifications, payment integration, user analytics, image optimization, and internationalization.

## Decision: 
Native, web, or hybrid app: We have decided to go with a hybrid app approach using React Native, to keep a consistent and maintanable workflow throughout all platforms.
UI Framework: For the UI framework we also chose React Native due to its wide adoption and the vast component library. 
Backend language: We chose Node.js for it's scalability and compability with javascript.
Permissions: Location, delivery tracking, and notifications for updates will be the permissions required.
Data storage: We will utilize SQLite to store essential user data and information about products.
Any additional frameworks or technology stacks: For push notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging will be integrated.

## Considerations:
The need for cross-platform compatibility and the convenience of a single codebase is why we chose React Native, a hybrid app envirionment. 
For the UI framework it makes sense to stick with React Native for ease of use.
The backend should be compatibile with JavaScript.
Permissions should be for user experience and enhancement.
Database should be able to have an offline mode that syncs when a network is established.

## Rationale: 
React Native allows us to write once and deploy on both iOS and Android platforms, significantly reducing the effort and time required. React Native boasts a vast and active community, ensuring a wealth of third-party libraries, plugins, and tools that can accelerate development. Using React for the UI framework will also allow a seamless development process.
Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it highly scalable which is necessary for handling a high volume of transcations. Using JavaScript across both the frontend and the backend streamlines development, allowing for shared knowledge within the team and reducing the learning curve.
SQLite supports our requirement for efficient data synchronization with the server once an internet connection is available. This also allows for an offline mode.
By limiting permissions to only location and notifications, we respect user privacy and minimize security issues/risks.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) provides a reliable, scalable solution for push notifications.

## Implications: 
By choosing React Native, development and maintenance efforts are streamlined across iOS and Android platforms. However, this approach may still encounter platform-specific issues. Expertise will be required.
A single codebase facilitates easier updates and bug fixes but might lead to compromises in performance or user experience compared to fully native apps.
Implementing offline mode with SQLite ensures that users can access product information and their order history without an internet connection. However, this requires careful management of data syncing to prevent conflicts or data loss.
